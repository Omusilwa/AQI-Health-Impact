# **🏥 Air Pollution Effects on Health – Data Science Project**
---

## **📌 Project Overview:**

This project explores the relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) levels and public health outcomes, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. By analyzing pollutant data and health impact metrics, the study reveals how air pollution contributes to increased health risks and proposes predictive modeling for proactive health management.
---
## **🎯 Project Goals:**

#### **Main Objective:**

- To assess the health risks associated with air pollution by analyzing AQI indicators and predicting health impact severity.
---
#### **Specific Goals:**

- 📍 Classify AQI levels based on EPA standards (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.)
- 🧪 Analyze pollutant concentrations: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃
- 📈 Measure morbidity frequency across AQI categories
- 🔗 Correlate AQI and pollutants with health impact scores
- 🤖 Build a predictive model to forecast pollution-driven health risks
---
#### **🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used**
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas – data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
- Scikit-learn – machine learning modeling
---

#### **🔍 Analysis Highlights**

**Dataset Size:** 5,811 records

**Average AQI:** 248.44 (Very Unhealthy range)

**AQI Distribution:**
- Over 60% of AQI readings fall in “Very Unhealthy” or “Hazardous” categories.

**Pollutant Contribution:**
- PM10, O₃, and NO₂ are the dominant pollutants driving poor AQI levels.

**Health Impact Observations:**
- Respiratory cases remain high across all pollution levels.
- Strong correlation *(r = 0.61)* between AQI and Health Impact Score.

**Model Performance:**
- Logistic Regression achieved 99% accuracy in classifying high-impact health cases with very low false positives.
---
#### **📊 Visual Insights**
The project includes:
- AQI category bar charts
- Pollutant composition heatmaps
- Scatter plots of health impact vs pollutant levels
- Confusion matrix for model evaluation
All visualizations are generated in Python using clean, reproducible code.
---
### **💡 Key Takeaways**
- Air pollution is a reliable predictor of health risk.
- PM10, PM2.5, and O₃ have the strongest negative health impact.
- Predictive models can be used by policymakers and health agencies for early intervention and air quality management.
